# schnaq academy

## Development

Start with

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Deployment

We deploy this repo on Vercel. Use this command, since it does not understand Clojure:

```
vercel build --prod && vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod
```

You need to have pro access to the schnaq orga on Vercel.
